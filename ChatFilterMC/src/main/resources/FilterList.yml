# Automatically replaced shortcuts:
# [senderName] -> Message sender's username
# [date] -> Current date in "MM/dd/yyyy HH:mm" format
# [msg] -> The message which triggered filter (only usable in automated commands)
# Example: [senderName] [date] [msg] -> Player1 [01//01/2024]: "Message with bad word"

# Modes:
# censor: replaces filtered words with **** but keeps the rest of the comment
# replace: replaces filtered message with 'replaceWith'
# clear: message is not sent at all

# msgToStaff: sends this message to all online admins if enabled
# commands: commands which run after a filtered word was detected
# history saves filtered messages to notes
# strikeActions: commands automatically run when maxStrikes is reached by a player
# to disable max strike: set to -1
